The main class which runs this application is:
TextFileAnalyzer.java 
when running this class the user will be prompted on the console to enter the name amd path of the text file to be interrogated.
It will then display the following information about the content of the file.

	•	Maximum word length and number of words with that length
	•	Minimum word length and number of words with that length
	•	Numbers of words within the file
	•	Number of words with different length.

There is also a Unit Test module being added to the project to help with unit testing the functions.
